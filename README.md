# Countdown (Round C - Google Kick Start 2020)

## Problem
 Avery has an array of N positive integers. The i-th integer of the array is A<sub>i</sub>.

A contiguous subarray is an m-countdown if it is of length m and contains the integers m, m-1, m-2, ..., 2, 1 in that order. For example, [3, 2, 1] is a 3-countdown.

Can you help Avery count the number of K-countdowns in her array? 

## Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing the integers N and K. The second line contains N integers. The i-th integer is A<sub>i</sub>.

## Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the number of K-countdowns in her array. 

## Limits
Time limit: 20 seconds

Memory limit: 1 GB

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

2 ≤ K ≤ N

1 ≤ Ai ≤ 2 × 105, for all i

<b>Test Set 1:</b>

2 ≤ N ≤ 1000

<b>Test Set 2:</b>

2 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> for at most 10 test cases

For the remaining cases, 2 ≤ N ≤ 1000
